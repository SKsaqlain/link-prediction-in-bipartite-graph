       "'ACT I\\n\\n\\nSCENE ONE\\n\\n_ALICE\\'S home. LEWIS CARROLL is discovered, playing chess. Golden-haired\\nALICE, in a little blue dress, a black kitten in her arms, stands watching\\nhim._\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nThat\\'s a funny game, uncle. What did you do then?\\n\\n\\nCARROLL\\n\\nA red pawn took a white pawn; this way. You see, Alice, the chessboard is\\ndivided into sixty-four squares, red and white, and the white army tries\\nto win and the red army tries to win. It\\'s like a battle!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWith soldiers?\\n\\n\\nCARROLL\\n\\nYes, here are the Kings and Queens they are fighting for. That\\'s the Red\\nQueen and here\\'s the White Queen.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nHow funny they look!\\n\\n\\nCARROLL\\n\\nSee the crowns on their heads, and look at their big feet.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIt\\'s a foot apiece, that\\'s what it is! Do they hump along like this?\\n\\n\\nCARROLL\\n\\nHere! You\\'re spoiling the game. I must keep them all in their right\\nsquares.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI want to be a queen!\\n\\n\\nCARROLL\\n\\nHere _you_ are \\r here _you_ are in your\\nlittle stiff skirt!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nHow do you do, Alice!\\n\\n\\nCARROLL\\n\\nAnd now you are going to move here.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nLet me move myself.\\n\\n\\nCARROLL\\n\\nWhen you have traveled all along the board this way and haven\\'t been taken\\nby the enemy you may be a queen.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWhy do people always play with kings and queens? Mother has them in her\\nplaying cards too. Look!\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nHere\\'s the King of Hearts and here\\'s his wife; she\\'s the Queen of\\nHearts--isn\\'t she cross-looking? wants to bite one\\'s head off.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nYou\\'re playing against yourself, aren\\'t you?\\n\\n\\nCARROLL\\n\\nThat\\'s one way of keeping in practice, Alice; I have friends in the\\nuniversity who want to beat me.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nBut if you play against yourself I should think you\\'d want to cheat!\\n\\n\\nCARROLL\\n\\nDoes a nice little girl like you cheat when she plays against herself?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nOh! I _never_ do! I\\'d scold myself hard. I always pretend I\\'m _two_ people\\ntoo. It\\'s lots of fun, isn\\'t it? Sometimes when I\\'m all alone I walk up to\\nthe looking glass and talk to the other Alice. She\\'s so silly, that Alice;\\nshe can\\'t do anything by herself. She just mocks me all the time. When I\\nlaugh, she laughs, when I point my finger at her, she points her finger at\\nme, and when I stick my tongue out at her she sticks her tongue out at me!\\nKitty has a twin too, haven\\'t you darling?\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nCARROLL\\n\\nI\\'ll have to write a book some day about Alice--Alice in wonderland,\\n\"Child of the pure unclouded brow and dreaming eyes of wonder!\" or, Alice\\nthrough the looking glass!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nDon\\'t you wish sometimes you could go into looking-glass house? See!\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nThere\\'s the room you can see through the glass; it\\'s just the same as our\\nliving-room here, only the things go the other way. I can see all of\\nit--all but the bit just behind the fireplace. Oh! I do wish I could see\\nthat bit! I want so much to know if they\\'ve a fire there. You never _can_\\ntell, you know, unless our fire smokes. Then smoke comes up in that room\\ntoo--but that may be just to make it look as if they had a fire--just to\\npretend they had. The books are something like our books, only the words\\ngo the wrong way. Won\\'t there ever be any way of our getting through,\\nuncle?\\n\\n\\nCARROLL\\n\\nDo you think Kitty would find looking-glass milk digestible?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t sound awful good, does it; but I might leave her at home. She\\'s\\nbeen into an awful lot of mischief today. She found sister\\'s knitting and\\nchased the ball all over the garden where sister was playing croquet with\\nthe neighbors. And I ran and ran after the naughty little thing until I\\nwas all out of breath and so tired! I am tired.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nCARROLL\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nTake a nap. Yes, you have time before tea.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nWe\\'re going to have mock turtle soup for supper! I heard mamma tell the\\ncook not to pepper it too much.\\n\\n\\nCARROLL\\n\\nWhat a funny little rabbit it is, nibbling all the time!\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nThere she is, let\\'s call her over.\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nDo you think she\\'ll come?\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nI\\'ll call softly, Alice!\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nHist, Alice.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nAlice!\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nHush--if she wakes and catches us--\\n\\n\\nBOTH QUEENS\\n\\nAlice, come through into looking-glass house!\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nI--don\\'t--know--how--I--can--get--through. I\\'ve tried--before--but the\\nglass was hard--and I was afraid of cutting--my fingers--\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nWhy, it\\'s soft like gauze; it\\'s turning into a sort of mist; why, it\\'s\\neasy to get through! _Why--why_--I\\'m going _through_!\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSCENE TWO\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWhy, you\\'re the Red Queen!\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nOf course I am! Where do you come from? And where are you going? Look up,\\nspeak nicely, and don\\'t twiddle your fingers!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI only wanted to see what the looking glass was like. Perhaps I\\'ve lost my\\nway.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nI don\\'t know what you mean by your way; all the ways about here belong to\\n_me_. Curtsey while you\\'re thinking what to say. It saves time.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI\\'ll try it when I go home; the next time I\\'m a little late for dinner.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nIt\\'s time for you to answer now; open your mouth a _little_ wider when you\\nspeak, and always say, \"Your Majesty.\" I suppose you don\\'t want to lose\\nyour name?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nNo, indeed.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nAnd yet I don\\'t know, only think how convenient it would be if you could\\nmanage to go home without it! For instance, if the governess wanted to\\ncall you to your lessons, she would call out \"come here,\" and there she\\nwould have to leave off, because there wouldn\\'t be any name for her to\\ncall, and of course you wouldn\\'t have to go, you know.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nThat would never do, I\\'m sure; the governess would never think of excusing\\nme from lessons for that. If she couldn\\'t remember my name, she\\'d call me\\n\"Miss,\" as the servants do.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nWell, if she said \"Miss,\" and didn\\'t say anything more, of course you\\'d\\nmiss your lessons. I dare say you can\\'t even read this book.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIt\\'s all in some language I don\\'t know. Why, it\\'s a looking-glass book, of\\ncourse! And if I hold it up to a glass, the words will all go the right\\nway again.\\n\\n  JABBERWOCKY\\n\\n  \\'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\\n    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;\\n  All mimsy were the borogoves,\\n    And the mome raths outgrabe.\\n\\nIt seems very pretty, but it\\'s _rather_ hard to understand; somehow it\\nseems to fill my head with ideas--only I don\\'t exactly know what they are.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nI daresay you don\\'t know your geography either. Look at the map!\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIt\\'s marked out just like a big chessboard. I wouldn\\'t mind being a pawn,\\nthough of course I should like to be a Red Queen best.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nThat\\'s easily managed. When you get to the eighth square you\\'ll be a\\nQueen. It\\'s a huge game of chess that\\'s being played--all over the world.\\nCome on, we\\'ve got to run. Faster, don\\'t try to talk.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI can\\'t.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nFaster, faster.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nAre we nearly there?\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nNearly there! Why, we passed it ten minutes ago. Faster. You may rest a\\nlittle now.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWhy, I do believe we\\'re in the same place. Everything\\'s just as it was.\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nOf course it is, what would you have it?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWell, in our country you\\'d generally get to somewhere else--if you ran\\nvery fast for a long time as we\\'ve been doing.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nA slow sort of country. Now _here_ you see, it takes all the running _you_\\ncan do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you\\nmust run at least twice as fast as that.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI\\'d rather not try, please! I\\'m quite content to stay here--only I _am_ so\\nhot and thirsty.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nI know what you\\'d like.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nHave a biscuit?\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nWhile you\\'re refreshing yourself, I\\'ll just take the measurements.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nAt the end of two yards I shall give you your directions--have another\\nbiscuit?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nNo thank you, one\\'s _quite_ enough.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nThirst quenched, I hope? At the end of three yards I shall repeat\\nthem--for fear of your forgetting them. At the end of _four_, I shall say\\ngood-bye. And at the end of five, I shall go! That Square belongs to\\nHumpty Dumpty and that Square to the Gryphon and Mock Turtle and that\\nSquare to the Queen of Hearts. But you make no remark?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI--I didn\\'t know I had to make one--just then.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nYou _should_ have said, \"It\\'s extremely kind of you to tell me all this,\"\\nhowever, we\\'ll suppose it said. Four! Good-bye! Five!\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWHITE RABBIT\\n\\nOh the Duchess! the Duchess! Oh! won\\'t she be savage if I\\'ve kept her\\nwaiting!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI\\'ve never seen a rabbit with a waistcoat and a watch! And a waistcoat\\npocket! If you please, sir--\\n\\n\\nWHITE RABBIT\\n\\nOh!\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nI\\'m very glad I happened to be in the way.\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nBread-and-butter, bread-and-butter.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nAm I addressing the White Queen?\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nWell, yes, if you call that a-dressing. It isn\\'t my notion of the thing,\\nat all.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIf your Majesty will only tell me the right way to begin, I\\'ll do it as\\nwell as I can.\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nBut I don\\'t want it done at all. I\\'ve been a-dressing myself for the last\\ntwo hours.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nEvery single thing\\'s crooked, and you\\'re all over pins; may I put your\\nshawl straight for you?\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nI don\\'t know what\\'s the matter with it! It\\'s out of temper. I\\'ve pinned it\\nhere, and I\\'ve pinned it there, but there\\'s no pleasing it.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIt _can\\'t_ go straight, you know, if you pin it all on one side, and dear\\nme, what a state your hair is in!\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nThe brush has got entangled in it! And I lost the comb yesterday.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nYou look better now! But really you should have a lady\\'s maid!\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nI\\'m sure I\\'ll take you with pleasure. Two pence a week and jam every other\\nday.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nI don\\'t want you to hire me--and I don\\'t care for jam.\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nIt\\'s very good jam.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWell, I don\\'t want any today, at any rate.\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nYou couldn\\'t have it if you _did_ want it. The rule is, jam tomorrow and\\njam yesterday--but never jam today.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIt must come sometimes to \"jam today.\"\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nNo, it can\\'t, it\\'s jam every _other_ day; today isn\\'t any _other_ day, you\\nknow.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI don\\'t understand you, it\\'s dreadfully confusing!\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nThat\\'s the effect of living backwards, it always makes one a little giddy\\nat first--\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nLiving backwards! I never heard of such a thing!\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nBut there\\'s one great advantage in it--that one\\'s memory works both ways.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI\\'m sure _mine_ only works one way. I can\\'t remember things before they\\nhappen.\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nIt\\'s a poor sort of memory that only works backwards.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWhat sort of things do you remember best?\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nOh, things that happened the week after next. For instance now:\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nThere\\'s the King\\'s messenger--he\\'s in prison being punished; and the trial\\ndoesn\\'t even begin till next Wednesday; and of course the crime comes last\\nof all.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nSuppose he never commits the crime?\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nThat would be all the better, wouldn\\'t it?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nOf course it would be all the better, but it wouldn\\'t be all the better\\nhis being punished.\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nYou\\'re wrong _there_, at any rate; were _you_ ever punished?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nOnly for faults.\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nAnd you were all the better for it, I know!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nYes, but then I _had_ done the things I was punished for; that makes all\\nthe difference.\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nBut if you hadn\\'t done them that would have been better still; better and\\nbetter and better!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nThere\\'s a mistake somewhere--\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nOh, Oh, Oh! My finger\\'s bleeding. Oh, Oh, Oh!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWhat _is_ the matter? Have you pricked your finger?\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nI haven\\'t pricked it yet--but I soon shall--Oh, Oh, Oh!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWhen do you expect to do it?\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nWhen I fasten my shawl again; the brooch will come undone directly. Oh,\\nOh!\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nTake care! you\\'re holding it all crooked!\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nThat accounts for the bleeding, you see; now you understand the way things\\nhappen here.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nBut why don\\'t you scream now?\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nWhy, I\\'ve done all the screaming already. What would be the good of having\\nit all over again? Oh! it\\'s time to run if you want to stay in the same\\nplace! Come on!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nNo, no! Not so fast! I\\'m getting dizzy!!\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nFaster, faster!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nEverything\\'s black before my eyes!\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSCENE THREE\\n\\n_When the curtain rises one sees nothing but odd black lanterns with\\norange lights, hanging, presumably, from the sky. The scene lights up\\nslowly revealing ALICE seated on two large cushions. She has been \"dropped\\nbehind\" by the WHITE QUEEN and is dazed to find herself in a strange hall\\nwith many peculiar doors and knobs too high to reach._\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nOh! my head! Where am I? Oh dear, Oh dear!\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nI\\'ve never been smaller than any table before! I\\'ve always been able to\\nreach the knobs! What a curious feeling. Oh! I\\'m shrinking. It\\'s the\\nfan--the gloves!\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nOh! saved in time! But I never--never--\\n\\n\\nWHITE RABBIT\\n\\nOh! my fan and gloves! Where _are_ my--\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nOh! Mr. Rabbit--please help me out--I want to go home--I want to go home--\\n\\n\\nWHITE RABBIT\\n\\nOh! the Duchess! Oh! my fur and whiskers! She\\'ll get me executed, as sure\\nas ferrets are ferrets! Oh! _you_ have them!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI\\'m sorry--you dropped them, you know--\\n\\n\\nWHITE RABBIT\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nShe\\'ll chop off your head!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIf you please sir--where am I?--won\\'t you please--tell me how to get\\nout--I want to get out--\\n\\n\\nWHITE RABBIT\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nOh! my ears and whiskers, how late it\\'s getting.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nIt\\'s a rabbit-hole--I\\'m small enough to fit it too! If I shrink any more\\nit might end in my going out altogether like a candle. I wonder what I\\nwould be like then! What does the flame of a candle look like after the\\ncandle is blown out? I\\'ve never seen such a thing!\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nDon\\'t stand chattering to yourself like that, but tell me your name and\\nyour business.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nMy _name_ is Alice, but--\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\nIt\\'s a stupid name enough, what does it mean?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\n_Must_ a name mean something?\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\nOf course it must; _my_ name means the shape I am--and a good, handsome\\nshape it is, too. With a name like yours, you might be any shape, almost.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nYou\\'re Humpty Dumpty! Just like an egg.\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\nIt\\'s _very_ provoking, to be called an egg--_very_.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI said you _looked_ like an egg, Sir, and some eggs are very pretty, you\\nknow.\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\nSome people have no more sense than a baby.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWhy do you sit here all alone?\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\nWhy, because there\\'s nobody with me. Did you think I didn\\'t know the\\nanswer to _that_? Ask another.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nDon\\'t you think you\\'d be safer down on the ground? That wall\\'s so very\\nnarrow.\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\nWhat tremendously easy riddles you ask! Of course I don\\'t think so. Take a\\ngood look at me! I\\'m one that has spoken to a king, I am; to show you I\\'m\\nnot proud, you may shake hands with me!\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nHowever, this conversation is going on a little too fast; let\\'s go back to\\nthe last remark but one.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI\\'m afraid I can\\'t remember it.\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\nIn that case we start fresh, and it\\'s my turn to choose a subject.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nYou talk about it just as if it were a game.\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\nSo here\\'s a question for you. How old did you say you were?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nSeven years and six months.\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\nWrong! You never said a word about it. Now if you\\'d asked _my_ advice, I\\'d\\nhave said, \"Leave off at seven--but--\"\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI never ask advice about growing.\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\nToo proud?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWhat a beautiful belt you\\'ve got on. At least, a beautiful cravat, I\\nshould have said--no, a belt, I mean--I beg your pardon. If only I knew\\nwhich was neck and which was waist.\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\nIt is a--_most--provoking_--thing, when a person doesn\\'t know a cravat\\nfrom a belt.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI know it\\'s very ignorant of me.\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\nIt\\'s a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say. There\\'s glory for\\nyou.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI don\\'t know what you mean by \"glory.\"\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\nWhen I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean--neither more\\nnor less.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nThe question is, whether you _can_ make words mean different things.\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\nThe question is, which is to be master--that\\'s all. Impenetrability!\\nThat\\'s what I say!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWould you tell me, please, what that means?\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\nI meant by \"impenetrability\" that we\\'ve had enough of that subject, and it\\nwould be just as well if you\\'d mention what you mean to do next, as I\\nsuppose you don\\'t mean to stop here all the rest of your life.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nThat\\'s a great deal to make one word mean.\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\nWhen I make a word do a lot of work like that I always pay it extra.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nOh!\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\nAh, you should see \\'em come round me of a Saturday night, for to get their\\nwages, you know. That\\'s all--Good-bye.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nGood-bye till we meet again.\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\nI shouldn\\'t know you again, if we _did_ meet, you\\'re so exactly like other\\npeople.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nThe face is what one goes by, generally.\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\nThat\\'s just what I complain of. Your face is the same as everybody\\nhas--the two eyes--so--nose in the middle, mouth under. It\\'s always the\\nsame. Now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose, for\\ninstance--or the mouth at the top--that would be _some_ help.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIt wouldn\\'t look nice.\\n\\n\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\n\\nWait till you\\'ve tried! Good-bye.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nOh! I forgot to ask him how to--\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIt isn\\'t marked poison.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nThis is good! Tastes like cherry tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey,\\ntoffy and hot buttered toast--all together. Oh! Oh! I\\'m letting out like a\\ntelescope.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nBut the lake is rising too. Oh! Oh! it\\'s deep! I\\'m drowning. Help, help,\\nI\\'m drowning, I\\'m drowning in my tears!\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nHjckrrh. Hjckrrh!\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSCENE FOUR\\n\\n_Is symbolic of a wet and rocky shore in a weird green light. The MOCK\\nTURTLE is weeping dismally._\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nHjckrrh. Hjckrrh. Hjckrrh.\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nDrop your tears into the sea with his.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nHe sobs as if he had a bone in his throat. He sighs as if his heart would\\nbreak. What is his sorrow?\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nOh, Gryphon, it\\'s terrible!\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nIt\\'s all his fancy that. Mock Turtle hasn\\'t got no sorrow. This here young\\nlady, she wants for to know your history, she do.\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nI\\'ll tell it her. Sit down both of you, and don\\'t speak a word till I\\'ve\\nfinished.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI don\\'t see how you can _ever_ finish, if you don\\'t begin.\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nOnce, I was a real Turtle.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nWhen we were little, we went to school in the sea. The master was an old\\nTurtle--we used to call him tortoise--\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWhy did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn\\'t one?\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nWe called him Tortoise because he taught us; really you are very dull.\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nYou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question.\\nDrive on, old fellow! Don\\'t be all day about it!\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nYes, we went to school in the sea, tho\\' you mayn\\'t believe it--\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI never said I didn\\'t.\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nYou did.\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nHold your tongue!\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nWe had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI\\'ve been to a day school too; you needn\\'t be so proud as all that.\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nWith extras?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nYes, we learned French and music.\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nAnd washing?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nCertainly not!\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nAh! Then yours wasn\\'t a really good school. Now at _ours_ they had at the\\nend of the bill, French, music, _and washing_--extra.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nYou couldn\\'t have wanted it much; living at the bottom of the sea.\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nI couldn\\'t afford to learn it, I only took the regular course.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWhat was that?\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nReeling and writhing, of course, to begin with, and then the different\\nbranches of Arithmetic--Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI never heard of Uglification. What is it?\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nNever heard of uglifying! You know what to beautify is, I suppose?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nYes, it means--to--make--anything--prettier.\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nWell then, if you don\\'t know what to uglify is, you _are_ a simpleton.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWhat else had you to learn?\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nWell, there was Mystery; Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography,\\nthen Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger eel, that used to\\ncome once a week; what _he_ taught us was Drawling, Stretching, and\\nFainting in Coils.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWhat was _that_ like?\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nWell, I can\\'t show it you, myself. I\\'m too stiff. And the Gryphon never\\nlearned it.\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nHadn\\'t time; I went to the Classical master, though. He was an old crab,\\n_he_ was.\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nI never went to him; he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nSo he did, so he did.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nAnd how many hours a day did you do lessons?\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nTen hours the first day, nine the next, and so on.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWhat a curious plan!\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nThat\\'s the reason they\\'re called lessons, because they lessen from day to\\nday.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nThen the eleventh day must have been a holiday?\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nOf course it was.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nAnd how did you manage on the twelfth?\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nThat\\'s enough about lessons, tell her something about the games now.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nSame as if he had a bone in his throat.\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nYou may not have lived much under the sea--\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI haven\\'t.\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nAnd perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI once tasted--no, never!\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nSo you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nNo, indeed. What sort of a dance is it?\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nWhy, you first form into a line along the seashore.\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nTwo lines; seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you\\'ve cleared\\nall the jellyfish out of the way--\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\n_That_ generally takes some time.\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nYou advance twice--\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nEach with a lobster as a partner.\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nOf course, advance twice, set to partners.\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nChange lobsters, and retire in same order.\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nThen you know, you throw the--\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nThe lobsters!\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nAs far out to sea as you can--\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nSwim after them!\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nTurn a somersault in the sea.\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nChange lobsters again!\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nBack to land again, and--that\\'s all the first figure.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIt must be a very pretty dance.\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nWould you like to see a little of it?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nVery much indeed.\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nCome, let\\'s try the first figure. We can do it without lobsters, you know;\\nwhich shall sing?\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nOh, _you_ sing, I\\'ve forgotten the words.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n  First Verse\\n\\n  \"Will you walk a little faster!\" said a whiting to a snail,\\n  \"There\\'s a porpoise close behind us, and he\\'s treading on my tail.\\n  See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\\n  They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?\\n  Will you, won\\'t you, will you, won\\'t you, will you join the dance?\\n  Will you, won\\'t you, will you, won\\'t you, won\\'t you join the dance?\\n\\n  Second Verse\\n\\n  \"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\\n  When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\"\\n  But the snail replied, \"Too far, too far!\" and gave a look askance--\\n  Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\\n  Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\\n  Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nThank you; it\\'s a very interesting dance to watch, and I do so like that\\ncurious song about the whiting.\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nOh, as to the whiting, they--you\\'ve seen them, of course?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nYes, I\\'ve often seen them at din--\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nI don\\'t know where Din may be, but if you\\'ve seen them so often, of course\\nyou know what they\\'re like.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI believe so, they have their tails in their mouths--and they\\'re all over\\ncrumbs.\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nYou\\'re wrong about the crumbs, crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But\\nthey _have_ their tails in their mouths; and the reason is--\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nTell her about the reason and all that.\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nThe reason is, that they _would_ go with the lobsters to the dance. So\\nthey got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got\\ntheir tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn\\'t get them out again.\\nThat\\'s all.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nThank you, it\\'s very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting\\nbefore.\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nI can tell you more than that, if you like. Do you know why it\\'s called a\\nwhiting?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI never thought about it. Why?\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\n_It does the boots and shoes._\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nDoes the boots and shoes!\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nWhy, what are _your_ shoes done with? I mean, what makes them so shiny?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nThey\\'re done with blacking, I believe.\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nBoots and shoes under the sea, are done with whiting. Now you know.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nAnd what are they made of?\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nSoles and eels, of course; any shrimp could have told you that.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIf I\\'d been the whiting, I\\'d have said to the porpoise, \"Keep back,\\nplease; we don\\'t want _you_ with us.\"\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nThey were obliged to have him with them, no wise fish would go anywhere\\nwithout a porpoise.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWouldn\\'t it really?\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nOf course not; why if a fish came to me and told me he was going a\\njourney, I should say, \"With what porpoise?\"\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nDon\\'t you mean purpose?\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nI mean what I say.\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nShall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille? Or would you like\\nthe Mock Turtle to sing you a song?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nOh, a song please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind.\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nUm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her \"Turtle Soup,\" will you, old\\nfellow?\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n  \"Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\\n  Waiting in a hot tureen!\\n  Who for such dainties would not stoop?\\n  Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\n  Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\n  Beau--ootiful Soo--op,\\n  Beau--ootiful Soo--oop,\\n  Soo--oop of the e-e-evening,\\n  Beautiful, beautiful Soup.\"\\n\\n\\nWHITE RABBIT\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nCheck!\\n\\n\\nMOCK TURTLE\\n\\nThey won\\'t let her stay in our square.\\n\\n\\nWHITE RABBIT\\n\\nThe Queen is coming this way.\\n\\n\\nGRYPHON\\n\\nShe\\'ll chop our heads off.

I\\'m glad you\\'ve begun asking riddles--I\\nbelieve I can guess that.\\n\\n\\nMARCH HARE\\n\\nSo you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nExactly so.\\n\\n\\nMARCH HARE\\n\\nThen you should say what you mean.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI do; at least--at least I mean what I say--that\\'s the same thing, you\\nknow.\\n\\n\\nHATTER\\n\\nNot the same thing a bit! Why, you might just as well say that \"I see what\\nI eat\" is the same thing as, \"I eat what I see!\"\\n\\n\\nMARCH HARE\\n\\nYou might just as well say that \"I like what I get,\" is the same thing as\\n\"I get what I like.\"\\n\\n\\nDORMOUSE\\n\\nYou might just as well say that \"I breathe when I sleep\" is the same thing\\nas \"I sleep when I breathe.\"\\n\\n\\nHATTER\\n\\nIt _is_ the same thing with you.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nWhat day of the month is it?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nThe fourth.\\n\\n\\nHATTER\\n\\nTwo days wrong.

It tells the day of the month, and doesn\\'t tell what\\no\\'clock it is.\\n\\n\\nHATTER\\n\\nWhy should it? Does _your_ watch tell you what year it is?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nOf course not, but that\\'s because it stays the same year for such a long\\ntime together.\\n\\n\\nHATTER\\n\\nWhich is just the case with _mine_.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI don\\'t quite understand you. What you said had no sort of meaning in it\\nand yet it was certainly English.\\n\\n\\nHATTER\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nThe Dormouse is asleep again.\\n\\n\\nDORMOUSE\\n\\nOf course, of course, just what I was going to remark myself.\\n\\n\\nHATTER\\n\\nHave you guessed the riddle yet?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nNo, I give it up, what\\'s the answer?\\n\\n\\nHATTER\\n\\nI haven\\'t the slightest idea.\\n\\n\\nMARCH HARE\\n\\nNor I.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI think you might do something better with the time, than wasting it in\\nasking riddles that have no answers.\\n\\n\\nHATTER\\n\\nIf you knew Time as well as I do, you wouldn\\'t talk about wasting _it_.\\nIt\\'s _him_.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI don\\'t know what you mean.\\n\\n\\nHATTER\\n\\nOf course you don\\'t. I dare say you never even spoke to Time.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nPerhaps not, but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.\\n\\n\\nHATTER\\n\\nAh, that accounts for it. He won\\'t stand beating. Now, if you only kept on\\ngood terms with him, he\\'d do almost anything you liked with the clock. For\\ninstance, suppose it were nine o\\'clock in the morning, just time to begin\\nlessons. You\\'d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the\\nclock in a twinkling! Half past one, time for dinner.\\n\\n\\nMARCH HARE\\n\\nI only wish it was.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nThat would be grand, certainly, but then--I shouldn\\'t be hungry for it,\\nyou know.\\n\\n\\nHATTER\\n\\nNot at first, perhaps, but you could keep it to half past one as long as\\nyou liked.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIs that the way _you_ manage?\\n\\n\\nHATTER\\n\\nNot I, we quarreled last March--just before _he_ went mad, you know. It\\nwas at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts and I had to sing.\\n\\n  \"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\\n  How I wonder what you\\'re at!\"\\n\\nYou know the song, perhaps.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI\\'ve heard something like it.\\n\\n\\nDORMOUSE\\n\\nTwinkle, twinkle, twinkle--\\n\\n\\nHATTER\\n\\nWell, I\\'d hardly finished the first verse when the Queen bawled out, \"He\\'s\\nmurdering the time! Off with his head!\"\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nHow dreadfully savage!\\n\\n\\nHATTER\\n\\nAnd ever since that, he won\\'t do a thing I ask! It\\'s always six o\\'clock\\nnow.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIs that the reason so many tea things are put out here?\\n\\n\\nHATTER\\n\\nYes, that\\'s it; it\\'s always tea time, and we\\'ve no time to wash the things\\nbetween whiles.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nThen you keep moving round, I suppose?\\n\\n\\nHATTER\\n\\nExactly so, as the things get used up.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nBut when you come to the beginning again?\\n\\n\\nMARCH HARE\\n\\nSuppose we change the subject. I vote the young lady tells us a story.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI\\'m afraid I don\\'t know one.\\n\\n\\nMARCH HARE and HATTER\\n\\nThen the Dormouse shall.

Everything\\'s got a moral, if only you can find it.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nThe game\\'s going on rather better now.\\n\\n\\nDUCHESS\\n\\n\\'Tis so, and the moral of that is--\"Oh, \\'tis love, \\'tis love, that makes\\nthe world go round!\"\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nSomebody said, that it\\'s done by everybody minding their own business.\\n\\n\\nDUCHESS\\n\\nAh, well! It means much the same thing, and the moral of _that_ is--\"Take\\ncare of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.\"\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nHow fond you are of finding morals in things.\\n\\n\\nDUCHESS\\n\\nI daresay you\\'re wondering why I don\\'t put my arm round your waist. The\\nreason is, that I\\'m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I\\ntry the experiment?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nHe might bite.\\n\\n\\nDUCHESS\\n\\nVery true; flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that\\nis--\"Birds of a feather flock together.\"\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nOnly mustard isn\\'t a bird.\\n\\n\\nDUCHESS\\n\\nRight, as usual; what a clear way you have of putting things.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIt\\'s a mineral, I _think_.\\n\\n\\nDUCHESS\\n\\nOf course it is; there\\'s a large mustard mine near here. And the moral of\\nthat is--\"The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.\"\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nOh! I know, it\\'s a vegetable. It doesn\\'t look like one, but it is.\\n\\n\\nDUCHESS\\n\\nI quite agree with you, and the moral of that is--\"Be what you would seem\\nto be;\" or, if you\\'d like it put more simply, \"Never imagine yourself not\\nto be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or\\nmight have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have\\nappeared to them to be otherwise.\"\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI think I should understand that better if I had it written down, but I\\ncan\\'t quite follow it as you say it.\\n\\n\\nDUCHESS\\n\\nThat\\'s nothing to what I could say if I chose.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nPray don\\'t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that.\\n\\n\\nDUCHESS\\n\\nOh, don\\'t talk about trouble; I make you a present of everything I\\'ve said\\nas yet.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nUhm!\\n\\n\\nDUCHESS\\n\\nThinking again?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI\\'ve got a right to think.\\n\\n\\nDUCHESS\\n\\nJust about as much right as pigs have to fly, and the moral--\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nDUCHESS\\n\\nA fine day, your Majesty.\\n\\n\\nQUEEN\\n\\nNow, I give you fair warning, either you or your head must be off, and\\nthat in about half no time. Take your choice!\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nQUEEN\\n\\nLet\\'s go on with the game.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nCAT\\n\\nHow are you getting on?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIt\\'s no use speaking to you till your ears have come. I don\\'t think they\\nplay at all fairly and they all quarrel so and they don\\'t seem to have any\\nrules in particular. And you\\'ve no idea how confusing it is with all the\\nthings alive; there\\'s the arch I\\'ve got to go through next walking about\\nat the other end of the ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen\\'s\\nhedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nCAT\\n\\nHow do you like the Queen?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nNot at all; she\\'s so extremely--\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n--likely to win,\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nthat it\\'s hardly worth while finishing the game.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nKING\\n\\nWho _are_ you talking to?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIt\\'s a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat--allow me to introduce it.\\n\\n\\nKING\\n\\nI don\\'t like the look of it at all; however, it may kiss my hand if it\\nlikes.\\n\\n\\nCAT\\n\\nI\\'d rather not.\\n\\n\\nKING\\n\\nDon\\'t be impertinent and don\\'t look at me like that.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nA cat may look at a king. I\\'ve read that in some book, but I don\\'t\\nremember where.\\n\\n\\nKING\\n\\nWell, it must be removed. My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed.\\n\\n\\nQUEEN\\n\\nOff with his head!\\n\\n\\nKNAVE\\n\\nBut you can\\'t cut off a head unless there\\'s a body to cut it off from.\\n\\n\\nKING\\n\\nAnything that has a head can be beheaded.\\n\\n\\nQUEEN\\n\\nIf something isn\\'t done about it in less than no time, I\\'ll have everybody\\nexecuted, all round.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIt belongs to the Duchess; you\\'d better ask her about it.\\n\\n\\nDUCHESS\\n\\nIt\\'s a lie!\\n\\n\\nCAT\\n\\nYou\\'d better ask me. Do it if you can.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nQUEEN\\n\\nCut it off!\\n\\n\\nKING\\n\\nIt\\'s gone.\\n\\n\\nEVERYBODY\\n\\nIt\\'s gone! It\\'s gone! Where, where, where--\\n\\n\\nQUEEN\\n\\nCut it off. Cut them all off!\\n\\n\\nEVERYBODY\\n\\nNo, no, no!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nSave me, save me!\\n\\n\\nKNAVE\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nTake a tart!\\n\\n\\nQUEEN\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nCut hers off! Cut hers off!\\n\\n\\nOTHERS\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nCut hers off, cut hers off, cut--\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nCURTAIN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT III\\n\\n\\nSCENE ONE\\n\\n_Is a garden of high, very conventional and artificial looking flowers. On\\na large mushroom sits the CATERPILLAR smoking a hookah. ALICE is whirling\\nabout trying to get her equilibrium after her fall. She goes to the\\nmushroom timidly and, conscious of her size, for her chin reaches the top\\nof the mushroom, she gazes at the CATERPILLAR wonderingly. He looks at her\\nlazily and speaks in a languid voice._\\n\\n\\nCATERPILLAR\\n\\nWho are you?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI--I hardly know, sir, just at present. The Queen frightened me so and\\nI\\'ve had an awfully funny fall down a tunnel or a sort of well. At least I\\nknow who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\\nchanged several times since then.\\n\\n\\nCATERPILLAR\\n\\nWhat do you mean by that? Explain yourself.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI can\\'t explain myself, I\\'m afraid, Sir, because I\\'m not myself, you see.\\nBeing so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nCATERPILLAR\\n\\nYou! Who are you?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI think you ought to tell me who you are, first.\\n\\n\\nCATERPILLAR\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nCome back. I\\'ve something important to say.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nKeep your temper.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIs that all?\\n\\n\\nCATERPILLAR\\n\\nNo.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nSo you think you\\'re changed, do you?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI\\'m afraid I am, Sir; I don\\'t keep the same size.\\n\\n\\nCATERPILLAR\\n\\nWhat size do you want to be?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI don\\'t know. At least I\\'ve never been so small as a caterpillar.\\n\\n\\nCATERPILLAR\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nIt is a very good height indeed.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nBut I\\'m not used to it; I wish you wouldn\\'t all be so easily offended.\\n\\n\\nCATERPILLAR\\n\\nYou\\'ll get used to it in time.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nAre you too big or am I too small?\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nCATERPILLAR\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nOne side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow\\nshorter.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nOne side of what? The other side of what?\\n\\n\\nCATERPILLAR\\n\\nOf the mushroom.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nTWO-SPOT\\n\\nLook out now, Five. Don\\'t go splashing paint over me like that.\\n\\n\\nFIVE-SPOT\\n\\nI couldn\\'t help it. Seven jogged my elbow.\\n\\n\\nSEVEN-SPOT\\n\\nThat\\'s right, Five, always lay the blame on others.\\n\\n\\nFIVE-SPOT\\n\\nYou\\'d better not talk. I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved\\nto be beheaded.\\n\\n\\nTWO-SPOT\\n\\nWhat for?\\n\\n\\nSEVEN-SPOT\\n\\nThat\\'s none of your business, Two.\\n\\n\\nFIVE-SPOT\\n\\nYes, it is his business, and I\\'ll tell him. It was for bringing the cook\\ntulip roots instead of onions.\\n\\n\\nSEVEN-SPOT\\n\\nWell, of all the unjust things--\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nCould you please tell me what side to eat?\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nTWO-SPOT\\n\\nI don\\'t know anything about it.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nYou ought to have been red, we put you in by mistake, and if the Queen was\\nto find it out we should all have our heads cut off.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWhat\\'s that?\\n\\n\\nFIVE-SPOT\\n\\nThe White Chess Queen.\\n\\n\\nSEVEN-SPOT\\n\\nDon\\'t let her see what we are doing.\\n\\n\\nTWO-SPOT\\n\\nShe\\'ll tell on us.\\n\\n\\nSEVEN-SPOT\\n\\nRun out and stop her from coming here.\\n\\n\\nFIVE-SPOT\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nNo, no, the other way.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nBut she\\'s off there!\\n\\n\\nTWO-SPOT\\n\\nYou can only meet her by walking the other way.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nOh! what nonsense.\\n\\n\\nALL THE GARDENERS\\n\\nGo the other way!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nShe\\'s running away from me.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nOh, there you are! Why, I\\'m just the size I was when I saw you last.\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nOf course you are, and who are these? I can\\'t tell them by their backs.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nTurn over. Ah! I thought so! Get up! What have you been doing here?\\n\\n\\nTWO-SPOT\\n\\nMay it please your Majesty, we were trying--\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nI see! Begone, or I\\'ll send the horses after you, and tell the Queen of\\nHearts.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nRidiculous!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIsn\\'t this the Eighth Square?\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nYou can\\'t be a Queen, you know, till you\\'ve passed the proper examination.\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nThe sooner we begin it, the better.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nPlease, would you tell me--\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nSpeak when you\\'re spoken to.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nBut if everybody obeyed that rule, and if you only spoke when you were\\nspoken to, and the other person always waited for you to begin, you see\\nnobody would ever say anything, so that--\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nPreposterous.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI only said \"if.\"\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nShe says she only said \"if.\"\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nBut she said a great deal more than that. Ah, yes, so much more than that.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nSo you did, you know; always speak the truth--think before you speak--and\\nwrite it down afterwards.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI\\'m sure I didn\\'t mean--\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nThat\\'s just what I complained of. You _should_ have meant! What do you\\nsuppose is the use of a child without any meaning? Even a joke should have\\nsome meaning--and a child\\'s more important than a joke, I hope. You\\ncouldn\\'t deny that, even if you tried with both hands.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI don\\'t deny things with my _hands_.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nNobody said you did. I said you couldn\\'t if you tried.\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nShe\\'s in that state of mind, that she wants to deny _something_--only she\\ndoesn\\'t know what to deny!\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nA nasty, vicious temper. I invite you to Alice\\'s dinner party this\\nafternoon.\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nAnd I invite _you_.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI didn\\'t know I was to have a party at all; but if there is to be one, I\\nthink I ought to invite the guests.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nWe gave you the opportunity of doing it, but I dare say you\\'ve not had\\nmany lessons in manners yet.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nManners are not taught in lessons; lessons teach you to do sums, and\\nthings of that sort.\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nCan you do addition? What\\'s one and one and one and one and one and one\\nand one and one and one and one?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI don\\'t know. I lost count.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nShe can\\'t do addition; can you do subtraction? Take nine from eight.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nNine from eight I can\\'t, you know, but--\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nShe can\\'t do subtraction. Can you do division? Divide a loaf by a\\nknife--what\\'s the answer to that?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI suppose--\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nBread and butter, of course. Try another subtraction sum. Take a bone from\\na dog; what remains?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nThe bone wouldn\\'t remain, of course, if I took it--and the dog wouldn\\'t\\nremain; it would come to bite me--and I\\'m sure I shouldn\\'t remain.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nThen you think nothing would remain?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI think that\\'s the answer.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nWrong as usual; the dog\\'s temper would remain.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nBut I don\\'t see how--\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nWhy, look here; the dog would lose its temper, wouldn\\'t it?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nPerhaps it would.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nThen if the dog went away, its temper would remain!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nThey might go different ways! What dreadful nonsense we _are_ talking.\\n\\n\\nBOTH QUEENS\\n\\nShe can\\'t do sums a bit!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nCan _you_ do sums?\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nI can do addition, if you give me time--but I can\\'t do _subtraction_ under\\n_any_ circumstances.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nOf course you know your A, B, C?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nTo be sure I do.\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nSo do I; we\\'ll often say it over together, dear. And I\\'ll tell you a\\nsecret--I can read words of one letter. Isn\\'t that grand? However, don\\'t\\nbe discouraged. You\\'ll come to it in time.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nCan you answer useful questions? How is bread made?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI know _that_! You take some flour--\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nWhere do you pick the flower? In a garden or in the hedges?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWell, it isn\\'t _picked_ at all. It\\'s ground--\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nHow many acres of ground? You mustn\\'t leave out so many things.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nFan her head! She\\'ll be feverish after so much thinking.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nPlease--please--\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nShe\\'s all right again now. Do you know languages? What\\'s the French for\\nfiddle-de-dee?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nFiddle-de-dee\\'s not English.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nWho ever said it was?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIf you tell me what language fiddle-de-dee is, I\\'ll tell you the French\\nfor it!\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nQueens never make bargains!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI wish Queens never asked questions!\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nDon\\'t let us quarrel; what is the cause of lightning?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nThe cause of lightning is the thunder--no, no! I meant the other way.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nIt\\'s too late to correct it; when you\\'ve once said a thing, that fixes it,\\nand you must take the consequences.\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nWe had _such_ a thunderstorm next Tuesday, you can\\'t think.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nShe _never_ could, you know.\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\nPart of the roof came off, and ever so much thunder got in--and it went\\nrolling round the room in great lumps--and knocking over the tables and\\nthings--till I was so frightened, I couldn\\'t remember my own name!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI never should _try_ to remember my name in the middle of an accident.\\nWhere would be the use of it?\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nYou must excuse her. She means well, but she can\\'t help saying foolish\\nthings, as a general rule. She never was really well brought up, but it\\'s\\namazing how good tempered she is! Pat her on the head, and see how pleased\\nshe\\'ll be! A little kindness and putting her hair in papers would do\\nwonders with her.\\n\\n\\nWHITE QUEEN\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nI _am_ so sleepy!\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nShe\\'s tired, poor thing; smooth her hair--lend her your night cap--and\\nsing her a soothing lullaby.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI haven\\'t got a night cap with me, and I don\\'t know any soothing\\nlullabies.\\n\\n\\nRED QUEEN\\n\\nI must do it myself, then.\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n  Hush-a-by lady, in Alice\\'s lap!\\n  Till the feast\\'s ready, we\\'ve time for a nap;\\n  When the feast\\'s over, we\\'ll go to the ball--\\n  Red Queen and White Queen and Alice and all!\\n\\nAnd now you know the words.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nJust sing it through to _me_. I\\'m getting sleepy too.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWhat _am_ I to do? Take care of two Queens asleep at once? Do wake up, you\\nheavy things!\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWHITE RABBIT\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nThe trial\\'s beginning!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nWhat trial is it?\\n\\n\\nWHITE RABBIT\\n\\nWho stole the tarts.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI ate a tart.\\n\\n\\nWHITE RABBIT\\n\\nYou\\'ve got to be tried.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI don\\'t want to be tried.\\n\\n\\nWHITE RABBIT\\n\\nYou\\'ve got to be tried.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nI won\\'t be tried--I won\\'t-I won\\'t!\\n\\n\\nSCENE TWO\\n\\n_Is a court room suggesting playing cards. The jurymen are all kinds of\\ncreatures. The KING and QUEEN OF HEARTS are seated on the throne. The\\nKNAVE is before them in chains. The WHITE RABBIT has a trumpet in one\\nhand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the middle of the court\\nstands a table with a large dish of tarts upon it._\\n\\n\\nWHITE RABBIT\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nSilence in the court!\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nWhat are they doing? They can\\'t have anything to put down yet, before the\\ntrial\\'s begun.\\n\\n\\nKNAVE\\n\\nThey\\'re putting down their names for fear they should forget them before\\nthe end of the trial.\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nStupid things!\\n\\n\\nWHITE RABBIT\\n\\nSilence in the court!\\n\\n\\nJURORS\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nStupid things!\\n\\n\\nONE JUROR\\n\\nHow do you spell stupid?\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nA nice muddle their slates will be in before the trial\\'s over.\\n\\n\\nQUEEN\\n\\nThere\\'s a pencil squeaking.

Why, you don\\'t even know what they\\'re\\nabout.\\n\\n\\nKING\\n\\nRead them!\\n\\n\\nWHITE RABBIT\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nWhere shall I begin, please your Majesty?\\n\\n\\nKING\\n\\nBegin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end, then stop.\\n\\n\\nWHITE RABBIT\\n\\n  \"They told me you had been to her,\\n    And mentioned me to him;\\n  She gave me a good character,\\n    But said I could not swim.\\n\\n  \"I gave her one, they gave him two,\\n    You gave us three or more;\\n  They all returned from him to you,\\n    Though they were mine before.\\n\\n  \"My notion was that you had been\\n    (Before she had this fit)\\n  An obstacle that came between\\n    Him, and ourselves, and it.\\n\\n  \"Don\\'t let him know she liked him best,\\n    For this must ever be\\n  A secret, kept from all the rest,\\n    Between yourself and me.\"\\n\\n\\nKING\\n\\nThat\\'s the most important piece of evidence we\\'ve heard yet; so now let\\nthe jury--\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nIf anyone of them can explain it, I\\'ll give him sixpence. I don\\'t believe\\nthere\\'s an atom of meaning in it.\\n\\n\\nJURY\\n\\nShe doesn\\'t believe there\\'s an atom of meaning in it.\\n\\n\\nKING\\n\\nIf there\\'s no meaning in it, that saves a world of trouble, you know, as\\nwe needn\\'t try to find any. And yet I don\\'t know.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nI seem to see some meaning after all. \"Said I could not swim.\" You can\\'t\\nswim, can you?\\n\\n\\nKNAVE\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nDo I look like it?\\n\\n\\nKING\\n\\nAll right, so far; \"We know it to be true,\" that\\'s the jury, of course; \"I\\ngave her one, they gave him two\" why that must be what he did with the\\ntarts, you know--\\n\\n\\nALICE\\n\\nBut it goes on \"they all returned from _him_ to _you_.\"\\n\\n\\nKING\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nWhy, there they are! Nothing can be clearer than that. Then again, \"before\\nshe had this fit,\" you never had fits, my dear, I think?\\n\\n\\nQUEEN\\n\\nNever!\\n\\n\\nKING\\n\\nThen the words don\\'t _fit_ you.\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nKING\\n\\nIt\\'s a pun!\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nKING\\n\\nLet the jury consider their verdict.\\n\\n\\nQUEEN\\n\\nNo, no!
